## Installation & Setup

### No Installation Required!
The script is completely self-contained and requires no setup. Simply download and run:

1. Download the PowerShell script and batch file
2. Place them in your repository root or any convenient location
3. Run the script - that's it!

### Verification
To verify the script works correctly:
```powershell
# Test the script help
.\migrate-dependabot-reviewers-windows.ps1 -Help
```

## Troubleshooting

### PowerShell Execution Policy
If you encounter execution policy errors:

```powershell
# Check current policy
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# Set policy for current user (recommended)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Or run with bypass (one-time)
PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\migrate-dependabot-reviewers-windows.ps1"
```

### YAML Parsing Issues
If the script has trouble parsing your `dependabot.yml`:
1. Ensure the file uses standard YAML formatting
2. Check for proper indentation (spaces, not tabs)
3. Verify the `updates` section structure matches Dependabot specification

### Common File Issues
- Ensure `.github/dependabot.yml` exists in your repository
- Check that the file has the correct structure with `updates` and `reviewers` sections
- Verify reviewers are properly formatted as a YAML array
